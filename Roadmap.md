# 🎯 Roadmap: RFID Attendance System (Local Prototype)

### **Phase 1 – Hardware Setup**

1. Buy **RFID reader (RC522 or PN532)** + some **RFID cards/tags**.
2. Connect RFID reader to **Arduino/ESP32** → connect board to laptop via USB.
3. Test with simple Arduino code: when card is tapped, it prints UID to Serial Monitor.

---

### **Phase 2 – App Development (React Native Desktop Version)**

1. Create a **login screen** for officers (username + password).
2. Build **main dashboard** with:

   * ➕ **Create Event** (e.g., “Sportsfest Day 1”)
   * 📋 **View Events** → Attendance lists
   * 👤 **Register New Student** (when unknown UID is scanned)

---

### **Phase 3 – Database (Local)**

1. Use **SQLite** (easy, built-in for RN).
2. Tables:

   * `students (id, name, uid)`
   * `events (id, name, date)`
   * `attendance (id, student_id, event_id, time_in, time_out)`

---

### **Phase 4 – Attendance Flow**

1. Student taps card → Arduino sends UID to laptop.
2. React Native app receives UID:

   * If UID exists → record **time in/out** in attendance.
   * If UID not found → officer prompted to **register student** (enter name/student no + save UID).
3. Officer can see **attendance list in real-time**.

---

### **Phase 5 – UI/UX (Make it Aesthetic & Easy)**

* Clean, modern interface (cards, large buttons, readable fonts).
* Officers can:

  * 📊 See attendance summary (Present/Absent).
  * ⏰ See timestamped logs.
  * 🔍 Search/filter by name or student no.
* Use a **color-coded system**:

  * ✅ Green for Present
  * ❌ Red for Absent
  * ⏳ Blue for Time-in only

---

### **Phase 6 – Reports (Optional but Nice)**

* Export attendance to **CSV/Excel**.
* Show event summary:

  * Total students
  * Present / Absent count
  * Time logs

---

### **Phase 7 – Presentation / Future Work**

* Demo with **dummy cards** (no need for real school IDs).
* Show working attendance log.
* In conclusion, propose:

  * Scenario A (local) → what you built now.
  * Scenario B (future) → cloud-based system for multiple officers/devices.
